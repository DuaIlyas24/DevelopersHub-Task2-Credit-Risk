# Task 2: Credit Risk Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
The objective of this task is to predict whether a loan applicant is likely to default. This is a binary classification problem where I used historical data to train a model to identify high-risk customers.

## 🛠️ Skills Demonstrated
- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values in `LoanAmount` and `Credit_History`.
- **Feature Engineering**: Encoded categorical variables like `Education` and `Married` status.
- **Machine Learning**: Implemented a **Decision Tree Classifier**.
- **Model Evaluation**: Analyzed performance using **Accuracy Score** and a **Confusion Matrix**.

## 📊 Results
- **Final Accuracy**: ~78.8%
- **Confusion Matrix Insights**: The model successfully identified 18 potential defaults, significantly improving over the baseline "guess-all" approach.

## 📂 Dataset
Loan Prediction Dataset (Kaggle).
